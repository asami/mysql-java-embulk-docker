mysql-java-embulk-docker
========================

This docker container is derived from the MySQL Docker Official Image.

https://github.com/docker-library/mysql

Especially a entrypoint.sh is derived from it.
So most parameters (e.g. MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD) are derived from it too.

The container supports the embulk to import database initial data.
